### Fend Nanodegree - Exploring JS Objects, Tools and Testing

You will be provided visual assets and a game loop engine, using these tools you must add a number of entities to the game including the player characters and enemies to recreate the classic arcade game Frogger.

### Brief introduction

In this game you have a Player and Enemies. The goal of the player is to reach the top, without colliding into any one of the enemies. The player can move left, right, up and down. The enemies move in varying speeds on their portion of the scene. Once a the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the start square. Once the player reaches the top the game is won.

### New skills applied from the Module:
* Practice object-oriented programming.

### Required:
* Player can not move off screen;
* Enemies cross the screen;
* Enemy-player collision resets the game;

### Additional features:
* Extended game design to reproduce original Frogger game;
* Cars as enemies instead of bugs;
* Floating logs to pass the river;
* Road blocks, frog and cars designed by me;
* Music;
* Lives, points, ending game management.
