### Task

The student is provided of visual assets and a game loop engine. Using these tools is needed to add a number of entities to the game including the player characters and enemies to recreate the classic arcade game Frogger.

### New skills applied from the Module:

* Practice object-oriented programming.

### Brief introduction

In this game you have a Player and a few Enemies. The goal of the player is to reach the top, without colliding into any one of the enemies and without splash into the water.
The player can move left, right, up and down by the arrow keys. The enemies move in varying speeds on their portion of the scene.

Once the player collides with an enemy, the player looses 1 life and moves back to the start square. When the top is reached, 1 life and 50 points are added to the player. The game is won with 5 visits to the top, if so points are multiplied by lives saved.

### Issue to fix

When the frog jumps on water either from terrain or from a log does not loose 1 life.
